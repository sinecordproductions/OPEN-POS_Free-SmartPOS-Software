## 🚀 Introduction

**Open POS** is a complete point of sale application designed for small and medium
businesses — especially for cafes and restuarants. It was
created by **Muhammad Sayban** under the **Sinecord Productions** company to give shop
owners a basic and useful, **free and open-source** alternative to expensive POS software.

Everything runs **entirely on your own computer**. There is no cloud, no account,
no internet dependency and **no recurring fees**. All of your business data —
products, orders, staff, expenses and settings — is stored in a local SQLite
database that never leaves your device.

This project is released into the **public domain** — anyone can download the
source code, **change its name, use it, customize it and sell it** with no
restrictions whatsoever. See [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt).

## 🧰 Tech Stack & Libraries

| Library | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| [**PySide6**](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/) (Qt for Python 6) | Complete GUI framework — windows, widgets, layouts, charts, styling |
| [**SQLite3**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) (stdlib) | Local embedded database — no server required |
| [**Pillow** (PIL)](https://python-pillow.org/) | Image handling — renders the store logo into thermal-printer raster bytes |
| [**pywin32**](https://pypi.org/project/pywin32/) | Native Windows printer API (`win32print`) — enumerate, open and write to printers |
| **Python stdlib** | `hashlib` (PBKDF2 password hashing), `logging`, `csv`, `threading`, `struct`, `pathlib`, `shutil`, `uuid`, `secrets`, `datetime` |

All chart widgets (`BarChart`, `LineChart`, `PieChart`, `HBarChart`) are **hand-drawn with Qt's QPainter** — no extra plotting library is needed.

---

## 📋 Requirements

- **Windows 10 / 11** (printer support uses the Windows printing API)
- **Python 3.10 or newer** ([python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- During installation, check **"Add Python to PATH"** (or use the `py` launcher)

> This is a **pure Python source project** — there is no bundled executable and no
> exe-building dependency in the repository. You run the source directly.

---

## 🔧 Installation

### 1. Get the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/OPEN-POS---Free-SmartPOS-Software
cd Open-POS
```

or download and extract the ZIP archive from GitHub.

### 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file contains:

```
PySide6>=6.5
Pillow>=10.0
pywin32>=306
```

> ⚠️ **Pillow is optional.** If it is missing, the app still works — it simply
> skips printing the logo on receipts. `pywin32` is needed for receipt printing.

### 4. Run the app

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (First Run)

On first launch, Open POS automatically:

1. Creates the SQLite database at `data/openpos.db`
2. Builds all required tables and indexes
3. Seeds **demo data**: default categories, sample products, tables `T1`–`T8`,
   sample staff, and default settings

Log in with the default administrator account:

| Username | Password |
| -------- | -------- |
| `admin`  | `admin123` |

> 🔐 **Security tip:** immediately open **Settings → Users** and change the
> default admin password.

---

## 📖 Usage Guide

| Section | What you can do |
| ------- | --------------- |
| **Dashboard** | Today's sales, order count, items sold, busy tables, 7-day sales chart, recent orders |
| **Quick Sale** | TakeAway and Delivery orders — assign waiter/rider, add items, print KOT, manage pending/completed |
| **Dining** | Tap a table card to open its order; print KOT / request bill / final bill / close table |
| **Products** | Manage product catalog and categories (name, category, price, cost) |
| **Expenses** | Log daily spending, manage expense categories, see monthly total |
| **Reports** | Filter by date/type/payment/waiter across 6 tabs; export any view to CSV |
| **Settings** | Store profile & logo, tax & charges, tables, staff, users, printing, backup/restore |

---

## 🖨️ Thermal Receipt Printing

1. Connect a thermal/receipt printer to the PC (USB or network) and power it on.
2. Go to **Settings → Printing**.
3. Pick your printer (or **System Default**), choose the **encoding** and **paper width**:
   - `42` characters = 80mm thermal paper
   - `32` characters = 58mm thermal paper
4. Click **Print Test Receipt** to verify.
5. Optional: enable **"Show logo on receipt"** under *Tax Management → Receipt Customization*
   and upload your logo in *Settings → Store*.

Receipts are generated as raw **ESC/POS** byte streams (see `app/printing/`) and sent
directly to the printer. Supported receipts: KOT, Requested Bill, Rider Copy,
Final Bill, and Test Print.

## 🗄️ Database Structure

All data lives in a single **SQLite** file at `data/openpos.db` (WAL mode, foreign
keys enabled). The schema is created automatically on first run.

| Table | Purpose | Key columns |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| `users` | System accounts | `username` (unique), `password_hash`, `salt`, `full_name`, `role` (`admin`/`manager`/`cashier`), `is_active` |
| `settings` | Key/value store | `key` (PK), `value` |
| `categories` | Product categories | `name` (unique), `sort_order` |
| `products` | Menu items | `category_id` (FK), `name`, `price`, `cost`, `is_active` |
| `tables` | Dining tables | `table_no` (unique), `seats`, `status` (`free`/`occupied`/`request_bill`), `current_order_id` |
| `staff` | Staff members | `name`, `role` (`Waiter`/`Captain`/`Runner`/`Rider`), `phone`, `is_active` |
| `orders` | Orders / bills | `order_number` (unique), `order_type` (`dine-in`/`takeaway`/`delivery`), `table_id`, `waiter_id`, `rider_id`, `cashier_id`, `status`, `subtotal`, `discount`, `discount_type`, `service_charge`, `tax`, `total`, `instructions`, `customer_name`/`phone`/`address`, `payment_method`, `closed_at` |
| `order_items` | Line items per order | `order_id` (FK, cascade), `product_id`, `name`, `price`, `qty`, `instructions` |
| `expense_categories` | Expense categories | `name` (unique) |
| `expenses` | Business expenses | `category_id` (FK), `category_name`, `description`, `amount`, `expense_date`, `created_by` |

Indexes: `idx_orders_created`, `idx_orders_status`, `idx_order_items_order`, `idx_expenses_date`.

A built-in **migration system** (`db.py::_migrate`) keeps older databases up to date
with minimal effort as the project evolves.

---

## 🗂️ Runtime Data & Configuration

| Item | Location |
| ---- | -------- |
| Database | `data/openpos.db` |
| Store logo files | `data/logos/` |
| Automatic backups | `data/backups/openpos_backup_*.db` |
| Logs | `data/logs/app.log` |

The `data/` folder is **automatically created** and is excluded from version
control (see `.gitignore`). Deleting it resets the app to factory defaults.

Application constants (name, version, paths) live in `app/config.py`.
Business settings are stored as key/value rows in the `settings` table and are
edited through **Settings → Store** and **Settings → Tax Management**.

---

## 💾 Backup & Restore

- **Automatic:** on every startup, if the last backup is older than 24 hours, a
  copy is written to `data/backups/`.
- **Manual:** *Settings → Backup / Restore → Download Backup* saves a `.db` file
  anywhere you choose.
- **Restore:** *Apply Backup File* validates the file (table presence + integrity
  check) and replaces the live database. You are signed out afterwards.
- **Factory reset:** *Clear All Data* deletes everything and re-seeds demo data
  (type `CLEAR` to confirm).

---

## 🔧 Customization & Development

Open POS is deliberately layered for easy modification:

- **Add a screen:** create a view in `app/ui/`, register it in `main_window.py::NAV`
  and update `ROLE_ACCESS` for permissions.
- **Change the look:** edit the global stylesheet in `app/ui/theme.py`.
- **Add a report:** extend `app/services/report_service.py` and wire it into
  `app/ui/reports_view.py`.
- **Change the data model:** edit `_SCHEMA` in `app/database/db.py` and add a
  migration in `_migrate()`.
- **Print formats:** tweak the receipt templates in
  `app/printing/printer_service.py` or the low-level ESC/POS builder in
  `app/printing/escpos_builder.py`.

Code style notes:
- The project targets **Python 3.10+** (uses `str | None` union syntax).
- Services are module-level singletons (`xxx_service`) bound to one database
  connection; rebinding is handled centrally in `db.py::rebind_services`.
- There are no external test frameworks configured; validate changes with a
  syntax check and a manual run:

```bash
python -m compileall app main.py
python main.py
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
| ------- | -------- |
| `No module named PySide6` | Dependencies not installed — run `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| "No printer is available" | Connect & power on the receipt printer, then select it in *Settings → Printing* |
| Receipt prints with wrong characters | Change the **character encoding** (try `cp437`) or paper width in Settings |
| Logo does not print | Install Pillow (`pip install Pillow`) and enable *Show logo on receipt* |
| "Database is missing tables" | The DB file is corrupt or old — restore a backup from `data/backups/` |
| App won't start at all | Check `data/logs/app.log` for the detailed error stack trace |
